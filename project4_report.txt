2. Catalog information about Index
- Show your catalog information about an index (tables, columns). 
table-name, column-name and index-name
index-name = table-name+"_"+column-name

3. Block Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your block nested loop join works (especially, how you manage the given buffers.)


4. Index Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works.
Each time leftIterator get a new tuple, rightIterator scan the right table to get the join result. If there are multiple join result, then the left tuple is same, right tuple is different until the right scan terminate.
Left Iterator get a new tuple.

5. Grace Hash Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works (especially, in-memory structure).


6. Aggregation
- Describe how your aggregation (basic, group-based hash) works.
basic join: use Iterator to scan all the tuples and get the result cased on the aggregation operation.


7. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?
No
- Have you implemented any optional features? Then, describe them here.
No
- Other implementation details:
No

6. Other (optional)
- Freely use this section to tell us about things that are related to the project 4, but not related to the other sections (optional)
